# # Coin Change
# 
# You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the fewest coins needed to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.
# 
# As an example:
# * Input: `coins = [1, 2, 3]`, `amount = 6`
# * Output: `2`
# * Explanation: The output is `2` because we can use `2` coins with value `3`. That is, `6 = 3 + 3`. We could also use `3` coins with value `2` (that is, `6 = 2 + 2 + 2`), but this would use more coinsâ€”and the problem specifies we should use the smallest number of coins possible.
# 
# There's test code below that you can use to check your solution. And at the bottom of the notebook, you'll find two different possible solutions.

# In[9]:


def coin_change(coins, amount):

    # TODO: Complete the coin_change function
    # This should return one value: the fewest coins needed to make up the given amount
    pass


# In[5]:


def test_function(test_case):
    arr = test_case[0]
    amount = test_case[1]
    solution = test_case[2]
    output = coin_change(arr, amount)
    if output == solution:
        print("Pass")
    else:
        print("Fail")


# In[ ]:


arr = [1,2,5]
amount = 11
solution = 3
test_case = [arr, amount, solution]
test_function(test_case)


# In[ ]:


arr = [1,4,5,6]
amount = 23
solution = 4
test_case = [arr, amount, solution]
test_function(test_case)


# In[ ]:


arr = [5,7,8]
amount = 2
solution = -1
test_case = [arr, amount, solution]
test_function(test_case)
