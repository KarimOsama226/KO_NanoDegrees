# ## Problem statement
# 
# Given the root of a binary tree, find the diameter.
# 
# Diameter of a Binary Tree is the maximum distance between any two nodes. The distance is measured by the number of edges between the two nodes.
# 
# Diameter for a particular BinaryTree Node will be the maximum of:
# 1. Either diameter of left subtree
# 2. Or diameter of a right subtree
# 3. Or sum of left-height and right-height

# You can use the following function to test your code with custom test cases. The function `convert_arr_to_binary_tree` takes an array input representing level-order traversal of the binary tree.

# 
# **Representing the binary tree with a Python list**
# 
# The above tree would be represented as `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, None, 5, None, None, None, None, None]`
# 
# Notice that the level order traversal of the above tree would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. 
# 
# Note the following points about this tree:
# * `None` represents the lack of a node. For example, `2` only has a left node; therefore, the next node after `4` (in level order) is represented as `None`
# * Similarly, `3` only has a left node; hence, the next node after `5` (in level order) is represted as `None`.
# * Also, `4` and `5` don't have any children. Therefore, the spots for their children in level order are represented by four `None` values (for each child of `4` and `5`).
# 
# **Diameter of Binary Tree**
# 
# In this example, the diameter of this binary tree is for since the height of the left child is two and the height of the right child is also 2.
