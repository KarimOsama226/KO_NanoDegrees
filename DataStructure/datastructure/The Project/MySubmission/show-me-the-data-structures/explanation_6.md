## Union Function

### Reasoning Behind Decisions:
Using a set to remove the duplicates and collect the data as a list for easier manuplation 
### Time Efficiency:
O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the first linked list
O(m) where m is the number of nodes in the second linked list
O(b) where b is the number of elements in the output list
O(n+m+b)
### Space Efficiency:
O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the first linked list
O(m) where m is the number of nodes in the second linked list
O(b) where b is the number of elements in the output list
O(n+m+b)
